# rustcap

X11 screenshot tool written in Rust because shutter doesn't have a package for my version of Debian.

So far very barebones, takes a capture of the whole screen and saves it to test.png.

Try it with ```cargo run```

## TODO

- Find a default directory
- Add user interface
- Clipping support
